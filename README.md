# Iceman

## Description

Iceman is a game developed as part of an advanced C++ class to hone object-oriented programming skills. This project provided invaluable experience in collaboration, marking the first time I've worked with a partner in tech, and offered real-world insights into teamwork and code integration using GitHub.
